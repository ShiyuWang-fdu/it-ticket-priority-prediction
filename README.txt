# IT Ticket Priority - Data Preprocessing

## Dataset
- Total: 8,469 tickets
- Classes: Critical, High, Medium, Low (balanced)

## What I Did
1. Cleaned text (lowercase, removed special chars)
2. Created features (text length, word count, combined text)
3. Split data 80-20 for train/test

## Output Files
- tickets_cleaned_with_features.csv (full data)
- X_train.csv, y_train.csv (training)
- X_test.csv, y_test.csv (testing)

## Next Steps for Team
